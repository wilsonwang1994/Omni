Extension Questions:
1. When the users type in the key words they want to search for, 'SearchBox.js' component will trigger the function in 'App.js', construct the correct url format we need, and send the request to iTunes API. After getting the result from iTunes API, I convert it to json format, and change the state of 'App.js' so that the children component 'MovieList' would know and go ahead to rerender the virtual DOM. Then, whenever we hover over the movie image on the website, the detail card will pops up and shows the rental price and description of the movie.

2. If I have another week to work on this application, I would make the front end looks better first because I only focus on the implementation in this project now. If I want to make the coworkers even happier, the design needs to be improved. Also, I would add some features such as searching by the genre of the movie and maybe have the movie sorted based on the ranking so that the coworkers can find the most popular movie right away.

3. I spent roughly 3 hours to complete this project in total.
